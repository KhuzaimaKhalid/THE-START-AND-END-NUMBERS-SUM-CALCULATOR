# THE START AND END NUMBERS SUM CALCULATOR
Description
The Start and End Numbers Sum Calculator is a simple C program that computes the sum of all integers from a specified starting number to a specified ending number. The program prompts the user for input and displays the calculated sum.

Features

Calculates the sum of all integers from the starting number to the ending number.
Displays the result to the user in a clear format.
How It Works
The program starts by displaying a welcome message.
It prompts the user to enter the starting number and reads the input.
It then prompts the user to enter the ending number and reads that input as well.
A for loop iterates from the starting number to the ending number:
In each iteration, the current number is added to the cumulative sum.
After the loop completes, the program prints the total sum of the numbers from the starting number to the ending number.
